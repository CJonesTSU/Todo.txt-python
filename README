A port of the popular todo.txt-cli project written in bash to python.

This REQUIRES GitPython. Running the script once will give you the URL to
download it. For `todo.py status` to work, it seems git 1.7.x is required. 
At least git 1.6.4 returns an exit status of 1 which causes an error and
prevents GitPython from completing the command. On a different machine, 1.7.4
works with it.

Enjoy, contribute, and feel free to clone. I'm doing this blind* as best as
possible for fun.

* By blind, I mean without looking at the source of the original todo.txt-cli
project. I'm working solely from my experiences with the script and
experimenting with the functionality while adding things I should probably write
as patches and send upstream... I'll wait to finish my version of the project
first though.

This branch (crypto) will be used to experiment with encrypting the
todo.txt related files and seeing how that will work with git. If you have any
ideas, contributions please feel free to fork and make a pull request.
