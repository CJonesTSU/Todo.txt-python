# Ironic that a project about managing a todo.txt file has a TODO text file

* Allow user to organize the todo's like the original (item based
    alphabetical sorting)
* Add -[+@#] flags to allow user to hide associated contexts.
* Rework toggling command line flags CONFIG["FLAG"] = Default, 
    if valid.flag: CONFIG["FLAG"] = not CONFIG["FLAG"]
* Research what happens when one flag is supplied multiple times with
    optparse
