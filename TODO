# Ironic that a project about managing a todo.txt file has a TODO text file

Just watched video at todotxt.com and realized ls needs to take arguments, i.e.
    todo.py ls @context +project #{yyyy-mm-dd} +project2
and each one is matched against the lines so that if the items are
    (A) Spam bar @blue +favorite_color
    (B) Eggs & Spam +favorite_color
    (A) Foo spam @green expires #{2011-09-20}
    etc., etc.
spam@foo:~/ todo.py ls @blue +favorite_color
1 (A) Spam bar @blue +favorite_color
spam@foo:~/ todo.py ls +favorite_color
1 (A) Spam bar @blue +favorite_color
2 (B) Eggs & Spam +favorite_color
spam@foo:~/ todo.py ls #{2011-09-20}
3 (A) Foo spam @ green expires #{2011-09-20}
