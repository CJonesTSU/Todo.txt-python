# Ironic that a project about managing a todo.txt file has a TODO text file

* Allow user to organize the todo's like the original (item based
    alphabetical sorting)
* Add -d flag to allow a user to use a different directory (allows 
    for multiple, non-intersecting, todo.txt files with different remote
    repositories, i.e. one for work, one for one project, one for another,
    etc.)
